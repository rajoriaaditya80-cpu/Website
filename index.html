                <h2>About the Book</h2>
                <p>
                    "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" is a business and self-help book written by Stephen R.
                    Covey.
                    It presents an approach to being effective in attaining goals by aligning oneself to what he calls
                    "true north" principles based on a character ethic that he presents as universal and timeless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Covey defines effectiveness as the balance of obtaining desirable results with caring for that which
                    produces those results. He illustrates this by referring to the fable of the goose that laid the
                    golden eggs.
