# Website Walkthrough

I have created the personal website with two distinct pages as requested.

## Pages Created

### 1. The Book Page (`index.html`)
- **Theme**: Aged Paper, Vintage, Warm.
- **Content**: Details about "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" and Stephen Covey.
- **Features**:
    - Custom "Aged Paper" background texture.
    - "Cinzel" and "Cormorant Garamond" fonts for a classic look.
    - Mood images generated for the book and efficiency concepts.

### 2. The Profile Page (`profile.html`)
- **Theme**: Professional, Clean, Modern.
- **Content**: Profile of Aditya Rajoriya.
- **Features**:
    - Clean white/gray background with blue accents.
    - Professional typography ("Lato").
    - Profile picture displayed prominently.
    - **Note**: I used placeholders for the CV content (Experience, Education, Skills) as I could not extract the text from the image. You can easily edit `profile.html` to add your specific details.

## How to View the Website

Since `npm` was not available, I created a static website. You don't need to run any commands.

1.  Open the folder: `C:\Users\arajo\.gemini\antigravity\brain\5a0c6eff-bb66-422c-8fcf-ad177aea0f92`
2.  Double-click on **`index.html`** to open the Book Page in your browser.
3.  Click the "The Author (Profile)" link in the navigation to see the Profile Page.

## Next Steps
- Open `profile.html` in a text editor to replace the `[Placeholders]` with your actual CV details.
- If the profile picture is incorrect (I had two images to choose from), rename `assets/profile_2.png` to `assets/profile_1.png`.
